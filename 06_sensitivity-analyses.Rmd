Purpose: Document robustness of results.
Content:

Alternative scoring for HPT (e.g., excluding ROA items that behaved inconsistently in the original study ).

Alternative ideology operationalisations (e.g., using only NS items, following FR-LF logic).

Excluding knowledge outliers, extreme SDR.

Class-level random slopes if needed.

A separate file keeps confirmatory vs. exploratory space clean.
